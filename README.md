# ESP-01 #

This project contains material resulting from my experimentations with the ESP-01 board, based on the ESP8266.

My main target, with these experimentations, is to get acquainted with the Espressif RTOS SDK.

Current repository is structured as follows:

* `code` folder: source code. Main entry point for documentation is [`design.md`](doc/design.md)
* `doc` folder: all documentation (reference, design, installation, etc.)
* `hw` folder: files relating to hardware side (schematics, reference documentation, etc.)
* wiki: information about builds, delivery, etc.

The development machine I use for this project is a *Mac* running *OS X El Capitan* (10.11.1).

Please bear in mind that I'm not experienced in adapting Eclipse to an embedded toolchain. Consequently, configurations I present in this project can be quite far from being optimized. My current target is not to set up the perfect development environment, but rather to get a working environment that I can use to develop code right now.
